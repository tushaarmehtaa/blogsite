I'm obsessed with laziness right now.

Not my own (though my family might disagree). I'm talking about your laziness. The user's laziness.

Why? Because I'm building a workout logging app, and I've got this idea: What if it was designed for the laziest person on Earth?

Think about it. The apps we can't live without? They're basically laziness enablers:

1. Zomato: I'm too lazy to go out and eat.
2. Instamart: I'm too lazy to get groceries.
3. Uber: I'm too lazy to find a cab and haggle over price.
4. Porter: I'm too lazy to deliver stuff to my friend.
5. Urban Company: I'm too lazy to go out for a haircut.

These apps aren't just making life easier. They're leveraging our natural state: avoiding hard work at all costs.

And, it all started with Google: Typos in earch query? No problem. Here's exactly what your brain was trying to ask.

<div className="my-6">
  <Image
    src="/images/google-search-example.jpg"
    alt="Google search example showing typo correction"
    width={700}
    height={400}
    className="rounded-lg"
  />
  <p className="text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2 italic">Google's search is the ultimate laziness enabler</p>
</div>

So here I am, looking at my workout app prototype, asking myself: "How can I make this effortless?"

I want it to be so simple that using it feels like cheating. Like you're getting away with something.

Because here's the thing about retention problems: they disappear when you solve for laziness. We're hardwired to stick with what's easy.

I'm curious: What's the laziest app you use? The one that makes you feel a little guilty about how easy it's made your life?

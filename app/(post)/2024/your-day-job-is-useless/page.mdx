*"I'm just doing this to learn, then I'm going to start my own thing."*

If I had a dollar for every time I heard that, I'd never need to work again.

But here's the thing: I used to be that person. And then I actually started something of my own.

You see when you're working at a company with 100, 200, or even 500 people, things get done no matter what. Code gets written, campaigns get run, and user interfaces get designed. Even if you're not working as hard as you should, things get done.

But when you're on your own or with a small team (less than 10 folks)? If you don't work, the company stops.

So, what's the best way to check if you can actually start something of your own? Start selling. Anything. Even if it's just your time.

And here's what will happen:

1. You'll realize how bad you are at showing up every day.
2. You'll realize how much you suck at creating processes.
3. You'll realize how much hearing "no" really hurts.

But that's exactly why you need to do it.

Because one of two things will happen: Either you'll realize you can't be your own boss and keep living a comfortable life, or you'll push through the shitty realization and start doing things that actually matter to you.

So, next time you hear yourself saying "I'm just learning here before I do my own thing," ask yourself: Are you really preparing, or are you just postponing?

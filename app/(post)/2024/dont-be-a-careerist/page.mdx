If you know me at all, you know I can't shut up about change and unpredictability.

Why? Because for the past few years, the world has been moving like its on steroids.

And if I'm not constantly talking about these things and not making the people I care about a little anxious about falling behind...

...well, then there's something wrong with me.

This has been my guiding principle throughout my life. Four years ago, I was studying biology. Three years ago, I was studying business. And now? I'm writing.

But who knows what I will do next? Maybe you'll see me building my own company in a couple of years. Or trading stocks. Or teaching. I can't make any promises.

But here's what I can promise: You'll never see me talking about settling down, retiring early, or resisting change. And you definitely won't see me planning my formal US education years in advance.

Because that's the definition of being a careerist. And that's just not my style.

Maybe it's not yours, either.

In a world that's moving at breakneck speed, the only way to keep up is to keep changing. To lean into the unpredictability. To be open to pivoting, even if it means doing something completely unrelated.

It's what keeps life interesting. It's what keeps us growing and becoming the best versions of ourselves.
